# CRED Synthetic Feedback Data - Feature Requests & Improvements

## App Store Reviews

### ★★★★ "Need Customizable Dashboard"
*by TechSavvy2025 - April 10, 2025*

The app is great for managing credit cards, but I wish I could customize the dashboard to show the information that matters most to me. For example, I'd like to see upcoming due dates, recent transactions, and reward points all on one screen without having to navigate through different tabs. This would make the app much more user-friendly and efficient. Otherwise, it's a solid app with good features.

### ★★★★ "Suggestion: Add Spending Categories"
*by FinanceGuru88 - March 28, 2025*

CRED has been my go-to app for credit card management for years. One feature I'd really love to see is more detailed spending categorization with custom categories. Right now, the spending insights are basic, but if I could create my own categories and see trends over time with visual graphs, it would help tremendously with budgeting. Also, the ability to export this data to Excel would be fantastic for those of us who like to analyze our spending patterns in depth.

### ★★★★★ "Great App, Could Use Family Sharing"
*by FamilyManager2025 - March 15, 2025*

I love CRED for managing my credit cards, but I wish there was a family sharing option. My spouse and I have separate accounts but shared finances, and it would be amazing if we could link our CRED accounts to get a holistic view of our credit card usage and bills. Maybe even with different permission levels so I could help manage payments without full access. This would be a game-changer for families managing finances together!

### ★★★ "Need Better Reward Redemption Options"
*by RewardHunter - February 28, 2025*

The app works well for bill payments, but the rewards system needs improvement. Instead of just offering random brand vouchers, I wish CRED would let us choose how to use our coins - maybe convert them to cashback, airline miles, or even donate to charity. Having more control over rewards would make the coins actually valuable again. Also, a wishlist feature for rewards would be nice so we get notified when items we want become available.

### ★★★★ "Suggestion: Add Bill Splitting Feature"
*by RoommateLife - February 15, 2025*

CRED is great for managing my credit cards, but I'd love to see a bill splitting feature. Many of my credit card purchases are shared expenses with roommates, and it would be super convenient if I could tag transactions and send payment requests directly through the app. This would save me from using multiple apps to manage shared expenses. Otherwise, the app is clean and user-friendly!

### ★★★★ "Need International Card Support"
*by GlobalTraveler - January 30, 2025*

I travel frequently and have credit cards from multiple countries. While CRED works great for my Indian cards, I wish it supported international credit cards too. Having all my cards in one place regardless of the issuing country would be incredibly helpful. Also, a currency conversion feature within the app would be useful for tracking spending across different currencies. These additions would make CRED the perfect app for global citizens.

### ★★★★ "Feature Request: Subscription Tracker"
*by SubscriptionOverload - January 18, 2025*

CRED is my favorite financial app, but I'd love to see a subscription tracker added. With so many recurring payments on my credit cards these days, it's hard to keep track of all my subscriptions. If CRED could automatically identify subscription payments and provide a dashboard showing monthly recurring costs with renewal dates and cancellation reminders, it would be incredibly valuable. This would help avoid unwanted charges and better manage monthly expenses.

## Google Play Store Reviews

### ★★★★ "Need Dark Mode Option"
*by NightOwlUser - April 5, 2025*

The app is great for managing credit cards, but it's missing a proper dark mode. Using the app at night is harsh on the eyes with the bright white background. A true dark mode (not just dimmed) would be much more comfortable and would save battery on OLED screens. This seems like a basic feature that most premium apps offer now. Otherwise, the functionality is excellent, and I appreciate the clean design.

### ★★★★ "Suggestion: Add Offline Mode"
*by RuralUser2025 - March 22, 2025*

CRED works great in areas with good connectivity, but I often travel to places with spotty internet. It would be really helpful if there was an offline mode that could at least show my card details, due dates, and pending payments. Then I could sync when I'm back online. This would make the app much more usable for people who aren't always connected. The core functionality is excellent though!

### ★★★★ "Would Love a Desktop Version"
*by ProductivityPro - March 10, 2025*

CRED is my go-to mobile app for credit card management, but I'd really appreciate a desktop version or web interface. When I'm working on my laptop and managing my finances, it would be convenient to access CRED without switching to my phone. A cross-platform experience would make the service even more valuable. The mobile app itself is excellent, with a clean interface and useful features.

### ★★★ "Need Better Transaction Search"
*by DetailOriented - February 25, 2025*

The app works well for basic credit card management, but the transaction search functionality needs improvement. I'd like to be able to search across all my cards at once with advanced filters like date ranges, amount ranges, and keywords. Currently, finding a specific transaction from a few months ago is too cumbersome. This would make the app much more useful for record-keeping and expense tracking.

### ★★★★ "Feature Request: Payment Scheduling"
*by PlanAheadPerson - February 12, 2025*

CRED is great for immediate payments, but I'd love to see a feature to schedule payments in advance. Sometimes I know I want to pay a certain amount on a specific future date, and setting this up ahead of time would be very convenient. Maybe even recurring payment options for those who like to pay weekly or bi-weekly instead of monthly. This would make the app even more useful for financial planning.

### ★★★★ "Need Better Notification Controls"
*by NotificationMinimalist - January 28, 2025*

The app functionality is excellent, but the notification system needs improvement. I'd like more granular control over what notifications I receive - maybe separate toggles for bill reminders, payment confirmations, reward updates, and marketing messages. Right now it's too all-or-nothing, and I end up missing important alerts because I had to turn off the overwhelming marketing notifications.

### ★★★★ "Suggestion: Add Virtual Card Feature"
*by SecurityMinded - January 15, 2025*

CRED is my primary credit card management app, and I'd love to see a virtual card feature added. The ability to generate single-use or merchant-specific virtual card numbers linked to my actual credit cards would add an extra layer of security for online shopping. This would be especially valuable given CRED already has access to our card details. Great app otherwise with a clean interface and useful features!

## Reddit Threads

### "Feature Request: Automatic Category Correction"
*r/CreditCardsIndia - April 12, 2025*

I've been using CRED for years now, and one thing that would make it even better is the ability to recategorize transactions and have the app remember these preferences. For example, if I categorize a particular merchant as "Groceries" instead of "Shopping," the app should apply this to future transactions from the same merchant. This would make the spending insights much more accurate and useful over time. Anyone else want this feature?

### "CRED should add a credit score simulator"
*r/personalfinanceindia - March 30, 2025*

CRED already shows our credit score, but what would be really useful is a simulator that shows how different actions might affect your score. Like "if you apply for a new card, your score might drop by X points" or "if you reduce your credit utilization to Y%, your score could improve by Z points." This would be super helpful for planning credit decisions and improving financial health. Would make CRED much more valuable as a financial tool.

### "Idea: CRED should add bill negotiation service"
*r/CreditCardsIndia - March 18, 2025*

Just had a thought - since CRED can see all our credit card statements, they should add a bill negotiation service like Trim in the US. They could automatically identify recurring charges that are higher than normal (like internet bills, insurance premiums, etc.) and offer to negotiate them down on our behalf for a percentage of the savings. This would add real tangible value beyond just convenience. Would you use something like this?

### "CRED needs a proper budgeting feature"
*r/IndiaInvestments - March 5, 2025*

I love CRED for managing my credit cards, but I wish they would expand into proper budgeting. Since they already have all my spending data, they could let me set monthly budgets by category and track progress. Ideally with rollover options for unspent amounts and warnings when I'm approaching limits. This would make CRED a more complete financial management tool instead of just a bill payment app. Anyone else want this?

### "Feature suggestion: Transaction disputes within CRED"
*r/CreditCardsIndia - February 22, 2025*

One feature I'd really love to see in CRED is the ability to flag and dispute transactions directly through the app. Currently, if I spot a fraudulent charge or billing error, I have to call the bank separately. If CRED could streamline this process by letting me select a transaction, provide a reason for dispute, and submit it to the bank through their platform, it would save so much time and hassle. Would be a genuine value-add.

### "CRED should add a card recommendation engine"
*r/CreditCardsIndia - February 10, 2025*

Based on my spending patterns across all my cards, CRED should be able to recommend which credit card would give me the most rewards for specific purchases. Or even suggest new cards that would complement my existing ones based on my spending habits. They have all the data already - putting it to work like this would add real value beyond just convenience. Would make the app much more useful for maximizing rewards.

### "Idea: CRED should add travel insurance verification"
*r/IndianTravellers - January 28, 2025*

Many premium credit cards offer complimentary travel insurance, but it's often hard to know exactly what's covered. Since CRED already has our card details, they should add a feature that shows what travel benefits and insurance each card offers before a trip. Maybe even let us activate the coverage directly through the app by registering our trip details. This would be super useful and would add real value to the service.

### "CRED needs a proper expense report feature"
*r/IndiaInvestments - January 15, 2025*

For those of us who need to submit expense reports for work, CRED should add a feature to tag business expenses and generate expense reports. Ideally with the ability to attach photos of receipts to transactions and export everything in a format that works with common accounting software. Since they already have all the transaction data, this would be a natural extension and would make the app much more useful for professionals.

## Twitter Feedback

### @WorkingParent

### @PrivacyAdvocate

## Quora Responses

### "What features would make CRED better in 2025?"
*Answered by Vikram Mehta, Financial Analyst - April 15, 2025*

As someone who's been using CRED since its early days, I think the app could benefit from adding a comprehensive tax management feature. Since they already have our spending data, they could categorize expenses that qualify for tax deductions, generate tax reports, and even suggest tax-saving investments based on our spending patterns. This would transform CRED from just a credit card management app to a complete financial assistant. They could partner with tax filing services to make the year-end process seamless. This would add tremendous value and justify the data they collect.

### "How could CRED improve its rewards system?"
*Answered by Neha Gupta, Marketing Professional - March 20, 2025*

CRED needs to make their rewards system more transparent and personalized. Instead of random time-limited offers, they should implement a proper loyalty tier system where consistent usage earns increasingly valuable benefits. They should also allow users to set preferences for reward categories (travel, shopping, dining, etc.) and prioritize offers accordingly. Additionally, a reward marketplace where users can directly exchange CRED coins for products, services, or even cashback at a transparent, consistent rate would be much better than the current gamified system. This would make the rewards feel more valuable and less gimmicky.

### "What financial features should CRED add next?"
*Answered by Rahul Sharma, FinTech Enthusiast - March 5, 2025*

CRED should expand into comprehensive financial goal planning. They could allow users to set specific financial goals (home purchase, education fund, retirement, etc.) and then provide guidance on how to achieve these goals based on current spending habits. For example, the app could analyze discretionary spending and suggest potential savings that could be redirected toward goals. They could even integrate with mutual funds and other investment platforms to allow direct contributions to goal-based investments. This would transform CRED from a payment app to a true financial wellness platform.

### "How can CRED improve for power users with multiple credit cards?"
*Answered by Ananya Patel, Finance Blogger - February 18, 2025*

For power users with multiple credit cards, CRED should add a smart payment optimization feature. This would analyze all your cards' due dates, interest rates, statement periods, and reward structures to suggest the optimal payment strategy each month. For example, it could recommend which card to use for which purchase to maximize rewards, which cards to pay off first to minimize interest, and even suggest balance transfer opportunities. Additionally, a consolidated statement view that merges all card activities into a single timeline would help track spending across multiple cards. These features would make CRED indispensable for credit card enthusiasts.

### "What privacy improvements should CRED implement?"
*Answered by Siddharth Kumar, Cybersecurity Expert - January 25, 2025*

While CRED offers excellent functionality, they should improve their privacy options. First, they should implement a "privacy mode" that allows users to use core features without granting email access - perhaps by manually uploading statements or using bank APIs with explicit consent for each fetch. Second, they should add end-to-end encryption for all financial data with a user-controlled key. Third, they should provide more granular data sharing controls, allowing users to decide exactly what data is used for which features. Finally, they should offer a complete data export and deletion option that's easy to use and truly comprehensive. These changes would address the privacy concerns many potential users have.

## Other Reviews

### "Feature Request: Automated GST Invoice Collection"
*LinkedIn Comment - April 14, 2025*

CRED has been a game-changer for managing my credit cards, but as a business owner, I'd love to see a feature that automatically identifies business expenses and collects GST invoices. The app could send automated requests to merchants for proper tax invoices when it detects a business purchase, then store these invoices linked to the transaction. This would save hours of manual work during tax filing season and ensure I never miss claiming input credits. Given CRED's connections with so many merchants, this seems like a natural extension of their service.

### "Suggestion: Add Financial Literacy Resources"
*Email Feedback - April 2, 2025*

I've been using CRED for about two years now, and while the app is great for managing payments, I think it could do more to promote financial literacy. It would be wonderful if CRED could add a learning section with articles, videos, and interactive tools about credit management, investing, and financial planning. Maybe even personalized content based on my spending patterns and financial behaviors. This would add real value beyond the transactional aspects and help users build better financial habits. The sleek CRED interface would make learning about finance actually enjoyable!

### "CRED should add a debt payoff planner"
*Customer Support Chat - March 24, 2025*

I love using CRED for managing my credit cards, but I wish it had a debt payoff planning feature. Something that would let me see different scenarios for paying down my balances across multiple cards - like comparing snowball vs. avalanche methods, calculating interest savings, and projecting payoff dates based on different payment amounts. Since CRED already has all my card details and balances, this would be a natural extension and would provide real value. It would transform CRED from just a payment app to a true financial improvement tool.

### "Feature Request: Collaborative Group Expenses"
*Facebook Comment - March 10, 2025*

CRED should add a group expense feature for trips and events. I often use my credit cards for group expenses like vacations with friends or family gatherings, and it would be amazing if CRED could help track who owes what. The app could let me tag transactions as group expenses, add participants, split costs (equally or custom amounts), and send reminders to people who haven't paid their share. This would eliminate the need for separate expense-splitting apps and keep everything in one place. Would make CRED much more useful for social spenders!

### "Improvement Idea: Card-Specific Rewards Tracking"
*In-App Feedback - February 27, 2025*

I have multiple reward credit cards, and it's hard to keep track of all the different reward structures and special offers. It would be incredibly helpful if CRED could add a feature that tracks card-specific rewards - showing how many points/miles I've earned on each card, progress toward bonus categories (like "3 months of 5x points on dining"), and upcoming reward expiration dates. Maybe even notifications when I'm close to unlocking a bonus tier. This would help maximize the value of each card and make CRED the ultimate credit card companion.

### "Need a Comprehensive Annual Spending Report"
*Customer Interview - February 15, 2025*

One feature I'd really love to see in CRED is a comprehensive annual spending report. At the end of each year, I want to see a beautifully designed breakdown of my spending across all categories, merchants, and cards - with year-over-year comparisons, unusual spending patterns, and insights about my financial habits. This would be incredibly valuable for annual financial planning and would leverage the data CRED already collects. The report could even include personalized recommendations for optimizing spending in the coming year based on my patterns.

### "Feature Request: Integration with Tax Filing Platforms"
*Email Feedback - January 30, 2025*

CRED should integrate with popular tax filing platforms. Since the app already categorizes all my credit card spending, it would be incredibly useful if it could automatically identify tax-deductible expenses throughout the year and then generate a report or directly export this data to tax filing software during tax season. This would save hours of combing through statements and ensure I don't miss any legitimate deductions. It would add tremendous value to the service and justify the premium positioning of the app.

### "Suggestion: Add Spending Challenges and Goals"
*Community Forum - January 12, 2025*

I think CRED should add customizable spending challenges and goals. For example, I could set a goal to reduce restaurant spending by 20% this month, or challenge myself to keep entertainment expenses under ₹5,000. The app could track progress, send encouraging notifications, and maybe even reward success with bonus CRED coins. They could also add social features where friends could join challenges together (while keeping specific transaction details private). This would add a fun, gamified element to financial responsibility and help users build better spending habits.

## Focus Group Insights

### "Need for Personalized Financial Insights"
*Focus Group Participant #12 - April 5, 2025*

"I appreciate how CRED makes bill payments easy, but what I really want is personalized financial insights. Not just basic categorization of spending, but AI-driven analysis that tells me things I wouldn't notice myself - like 'you spend 40% more on dining out on weekends' or 'your grocery spending spikes at month-end.' Then follow that with actionable suggestions like 'shifting your major grocery shopping to mid-month could save you approximately ₹2,000.' That kind of intelligent analysis would make CRED truly valuable beyond just convenience."

### "Request for Milestone-Based Rewards"
*Focus Group Participant #7 - April 5, 2025*

"The current rewards system feels random and often irrelevant to me. I'd prefer milestone-based rewards that celebrate positive financial behaviors. For example, reward me when I pay my full statement balance for six consecutive months, or when I keep my credit utilization under 30% for a quarter. These rewards could be more substantial and meaningful than the current small discounts on random brands. This would align CRED's incentives with actually helping users build good credit habits, which is supposedly their mission."

### "Need for Comprehensive Credit Building Tools"
*Focus Group Participant #23 - April 5, 2025*

"CRED shows my credit score, but doesn't really help me improve it in a systematic way. I'd love to see a comprehensive credit building section that includes educational content about credit factors, personalized recommendations for improving my specific score, simulations showing how different actions might affect my score, and progress tracking over time. Maybe even include features like rent reporting or utility payment reporting to help build credit history. This would make CRED much more valuable for younger users still establishing their credit."

### "Feature Request: Financial Document Storage"
*Focus Group Participant #18 - April 5, 2025*

"CRED already stores my credit card information securely, so why not expand this to be a secure vault for all my financial documents? I'd love to be able to store insurance policies, investment statements, property documents, and other financial paperwork in the same secure environment, properly organized and easily searchable. Maybe even add OCR to extract key information like policy numbers, renewal dates, and coverage amounts. This would make CRED a more comprehensive financial management tool and increase user stickiness."

### "Suggestion: Add Merchant-Specific Insights"
*Focus Group Participant #3 - April 5, 2025*

"I'd find it valuable if CRED provided merchant-specific insights about my spending. For example, showing me that my average order at a particular restaurant has increased by 25% over the past year, or that I visit a certain coffee shop twice as often as last year. This granular level of insight would help me be more mindful about specific spending habits. Even better if the app could compare my spending at specific merchants to similar users (anonymized, of course) to help identify where I might be overspending compared to peers."

## User Interviews

### "Need for Automated Expense Anomaly Detection"
*User Interview - April 18, 2025*

"One feature I'd really value in CRED is automated anomaly detection for expenses. The app should be able to identify unusual spending patterns - like if my electricity bill suddenly doubles, or if I'm charged twice by the same merchant, or if a subscription price increases. These anomalies should trigger smart notifications that not only alert me but also provide context and suggested actions. This would help catch billing errors and price increases that often go unnoticed and would add real protective value beyond just payment convenience."

### "Feature Request: Household Finance Management"
*User Interview - April 16, 2025*

"As the financial manager for my household, I'd love if CRED added a comprehensive household finance management feature. This would go beyond just linking accounts with family members - it would provide a holistic view of household income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Ideally with role-based access so family members can have different levels of visibility and control. The app could help with household budgeting, tracking shared goals, and even managing allowances for kids. This would make CRED the central financial hub for the entire family."

### "Suggestion: Add Spending Heatmap"
*User Interview - April 14, 2025*

"I'd find it really useful if CRED added a visual spending heatmap that shows which days of the month or week I tend to spend the most. This would help me identify patterns I might not be aware of - like maybe I spend more on weekends or right after payday. The visualization could use color gradients to make it immediately obvious when my high-spending periods occur. This kind of insight would help me plan better and potentially adjust my habits to spread spending more evenly throughout the month."

### "Need for Automated Receipt Capture"
*User Interview - April 12, 2025*

"I wish CRED would add an automated receipt capture feature. The app could send a notification after detecting a card transaction and prompt me to quickly snap a photo of the receipt. These receipts would then be stored with the transaction data, making it easy to find them later for returns, warranties, expense reports, or tax purposes. Ideally with OCR to extract key information like items purchased and warranty periods. This would eliminate the need for a separate receipt management app and add significant practical value to CRED."

### "Feature Request: Smart Payment Reminders"
*User Interview - April 10, 2025*

"I'd love if CRED had smarter payment reminders that adapt to my behavior patterns. For example, if I typically pay my bills on weekends, it should remind me on Friday or Saturday, not on the actual due date if that falls mid-week. Or if I usually pay in the evening, send reminders then, not in the morning. The app could also learn which reminders I respond to versus ignore, and adjust accordingly. This kind of personalized notification system would make the app feel more intelligent and attuned to my actual habits."

## Beta Tester Feedback

### "Suggestion: Add Financial Health Score"
*Beta Tester #42 - April 15, 2025*

"Beyond just showing credit scores, CRED should develop a comprehensive 'Financial Health Score' that takes into account multiple factors: credit utilization, payment history, savings rate, debt-to-income ratio, investment diversification, and emergency fund adequacy. This score would give users a holistic view of their financial wellness beyond just creditworthiness. The app could then provide personalized recommendations for improving specific aspects of financial health, turning CRED into a true financial wellness platform rather than just a payment app."

### "Feature Request: AI Financial Assistant"
*Beta Tester #17 - April 13, 2025*

"I'd love to see CRED implement an AI financial assistant that I could chat with about my finances. I could ask questions like 'How much did I spend on dining last month compared to the previous month?' or 'What's my average daily spending this week?' or even 'If I want to save ₹50,000 by December, how much should I set aside each month?' The assistant could provide insights, answer questions, and offer suggestions based on my spending patterns and financial goals. This would make financial management more conversational and accessible."

### "Need for Predictive Cash Flow Analysis"
*Beta Tester #29 - April 11, 2025*

"CRED should add predictive cash flow analysis that forecasts my financial situation in the coming weeks and months. By analyzing recurring expenses, regular income patterns, and upcoming bills, the app could show me when I might face cash crunches or have surplus funds. This would help with planning large purchases, avoiding overdrafts, and optimizing when to make investments or extra debt payments. The visualization should be simple and intuitive, perhaps with a calendar view showing projected daily balances."

### "Suggestion: Add Spending Comparisons with Peers"
*Beta Tester #8 - April 9, 2025*

"I'd find it valuable if CRED offered anonymized spending comparisons with peers in similar income brackets or life situations. For example, showing that I spend 20% more on dining than the average person with my income, or that my utility bills are 15% higher than similar households in my area. This kind of benchmarking would help identify areas where I might be overspending and provide context for my financial decisions. Of course, this should be completely opt-in with strong privacy controls."

### "Feature Request: Integrated Investment Tracking"
*Beta Tester #35 - April 7, 2025*

"Since CRED already has visibility into my spending habits, it would be incredibly useful if it could also track my investments to provide a complete financial picture. The app could integrate with mutual fund platforms, stock brokerages, and crypto exchanges to show my asset allocation, investment performance, and how my spending patterns affect my ability to invest. This holistic view would help users balance current consumption with long-term financial goals and make CRED a true financial command center."

## Customer Support Interactions

### "Request for Enhanced Travel Features"
*Customer Support Chat - April 17, 2025*

"As someone who travels frequently, I'd love to see CRED add enhanced travel features. The app could automatically detect when I'm traveling based on transaction locations and activate special features like currency conversion without extra taps, highlighting which cards have no foreign transaction fees, and providing emergency contact information for card issuers while abroad. Maybe even integrate with travel insurance provided by premium cards to make claims easier. This would make CRED especially valuable for frequent travelers and justify the premium positioning."

### "Suggestion: Add Sustainable Spending Insights"
*Customer Support Email - April 15, 2025*

"I'm increasingly conscious about the environmental impact of my purchases, and I'd love if CRED could add sustainability insights to my spending data. The app could estimate the carbon footprint of different purchases, highlight merchants with strong sustainability practices, and suggest more eco-friendly alternatives. Maybe even gamify sustainable choices by awarding extra CRED coins for green purchases. This would appeal to environmentally conscious users and help CRED stand out with a unique, forward-thinking feature that aligns with growing consumer values."

### "Feature Request: Automated Savings Rules"
*Customer Support Chat - April 13, 2025*

"I'd love to see CRED add automated savings rules that work with my spending patterns. For example, I could set rules like 'round up every transaction to the nearest ₹100 and transfer the difference to savings' or 'automatically save 5% of any refund received' or 'if I spend less than my restaurant budget this month, save the difference.' These micro-savings would accumulate without requiring constant manual transfers. Ideally, CRED could partner with banks to make these transfers seamless or even offer their own high-yield savings option."

### "Need for Better EMI Management"
*Customer Support Email - April 11, 2025*

"While CRED shows my ongoing EMIs, I'd like a more comprehensive EMI management feature. This would include the ability to simulate converting purchases to EMIs before I make them, comparing different EMI terms side by side, tracking the total interest paid across all EMIs, and providing alerts when a no-cost EMI option might be available for a recent purchase. The app could even suggest consolidating multiple EMIs when beneficial. This would make CRED much more valuable for those of us who regularly use EMI options."

### "Suggestion: Add Financial Goal Visualization"
*Customer Support Chat - April 9, 2025*

"I'd love if CRED added better visualization tools for financial goals. Instead of just numbers, show me visual progress bars, countdown timers to target dates, and projections of when I'll reach my goals based on current saving rates. Maybe even use AR to visualize what I'm saving for - like showing a 3D model of the car I'm saving for that becomes more detailed as I get closer to my goal. Making goals visual and tangible would be more motivating than just tracking numbers and would differentiate CRED from other financial apps."
