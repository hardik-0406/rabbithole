### ★★★ "Declining Rewards"
*by Shilpa K. - August 27, 2024*

Cred has reached its limit now. Even on paying credit card bills (with assured cashback), didn't receive any. I thought it was a glitch but made atleast 10-12 payments today but received none. I'm extremely dejected, gotta uninstall it. It has been happening with me for a very long time now. When my friends get around ₹ 2-5 cashback, I receive a slap. It has made me heartbroken.

*Response from Dreamplug Technologies:*
Hi Shilpa, rewards are an important part of the CRED experience, and wouldn't want you to feel that they're not worth it. We will be reaching out to you to collect your detailed feedback so we can come up with even more rewarding experiences for our members in the days to come.

### ★★★★ "Good for Payments, Missing Features"
*by Rajesh M. - August 15, 2024*

For payments, It's fast, clean and reliable. My default app for retail payments (unless there is new app which giving cashback). Suggestion - I make so many tnxs that I find it difficult remember the payments that I did when I am tallying the acnts sometimes. Adding the location info on the payments will help remembering the txns. Paytm had this functionality. Helped alot in remembering the context to payment.

### ★★★★★ "Best Credit Card Manager"
*by Ankit S. - July 30, 2024*

CRED is the best app for managing credit cards. The UI is clean and intuitive, making it easy to track spending and pay bills on time. The reminders are helpful, and the spending insights give me a clear picture of where my money is going. While the rewards aren't as good as they used to be, the convenience factor makes it worth using.

### ★★ "Aggressive Marketing"
*by Priya T. - July 15, 2024*

The app has become too aggressive with marketing their financial products. Every time I open the app, I'm bombarded with offers for CRED Cash or CRED Mint. The core functionality of bill payments works well, but the constant push to take loans or invest is annoying. Also, the rewards have become almost non-existent compared to earlier.

### ★★★★★ "Premium Experience"
*by Vikram J. - June 28, 2024*

CRED offers a premium experience that no other financial app in India provides. The interface is sleek and intuitive, making bill payments a breeze. I love the hidden charge detection feature which has saved me money multiple times. The rewards aren't as generous as before, but the app's core functionality is excellent.

### ★★ "Privacy Concerns"
*by Neha R. - June 15, 2024*

While the app functions well for credit card management, I'm increasingly concerned about the amount of data they collect. They require access to emails and SMS, which feels invasive. After trying to delete my account, I found it difficult to completely remove my data from their systems. The rewards aren't worth the privacy trade-off anymore.

### ★★★★ "Convenient but Rewards Declining"
*by Arun K. - May 30, 2024*

CRED is very convenient for managing multiple credit cards and making payments. The interface is clean and user-friendly. However, the rewards have significantly decreased over time. Earlier I used to get decent cashbacks on bill payments, but now it's minimal. Still, it's the best credit card management app available.

### ★★ "Customer Service Issues"
*by Meera P. - May 15, 2024*

The app itself works well, but their customer service is terrible. I had an issue with a payment that failed but the money was debited from my account. It took over 2 weeks and multiple emails to get a response, and even then the issue wasn't resolved properly. They need to improve their support system significantly.

### ★★★★★ "Great for Multiple Cards"
*by Sanjay D. - April 28, 2024*

As someone with 5 different credit cards, CRED has been a game-changer. I no longer miss payments or have to juggle multiple banking apps. The consolidated view of all my cards and spending is invaluable. The rewards aren't amazing anymore, but the convenience factor is worth it. Highly recommended for anyone with multiple credit cards.

### ★★★ "Mixed Experience"
*by Kavita S. - April 10, 2024*

I have mixed feelings about CRED. On one hand, the app is beautifully designed and makes credit card management easy. On the other hand, the rewards have been steadily decreasing, and they're pushing their own financial products more aggressively. It's still useful, but not as exciting as it once was.

## Older Reviews (2022-2023)

### ★★★★★ "Game Changer"
*by Rahul M. - December 5, 2023*

CRED has completely changed how I manage my finances. The app is beautifully designed, intuitive to use, and offers valuable insights into my spending habits. The rewards program is decent, though not as generous as it used to be. Still, the convenience of managing all my credit cards in one place makes it worthwhile.

### ★★★★ "Great UI, Decent Rewards"
*by Pooja L. - October 18, 2023*

The user interface of CRED is probably the best I've seen in any financial app. It's clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The rewards program is decent, though it seems to have been better in the past. I appreciate the bill reminders and the ability to see all my credit cards in one place. Solid app overall.

### ★★★ "Declining Value"
*by Amit G. - August 30, 2023*

I've been using CRED since 2020, and it's sad to see how much the value proposition has declined. The rewards used to be generous, but now they're almost non-existent. The app still works well for bill payments, but there's little incentive to use it over direct bank payments anymore. They've clearly shifted their focus to pushing loans and other financial products.

### ★★★★★ "Premium Experience"
*by Nisha J. - July 15, 2023*

CRED offers a premium experience that makes you feel valued as a customer. The interface is sleek, the features are useful, and the overall experience is top-notch. I particularly appreciate the hidden charge detection and spending insights. The rewards aren't amazing, but the convenience factor makes up for it.

### ★★ "Privacy Issues"
*by Karan S. - May 22, 2023*

While the app functions well, I'm concerned about the amount of data they collect. They require access to emails and SMS, which seems excessive for a bill payment app. I also find it difficult to opt out of their marketing communications. The rewards aren't worth the privacy trade-off for me.

### ★★★★ "Convenient but Pushy"
*by Divya R. - March 10, 2023*

CRED is very convenient for managing multiple credit cards and making payments. The interface is clean and user-friendly. However, they've become increasingly pushy with their own financial products. The constant notifications trying to get me to take loans or invest are annoying. Still, it's the best credit card management app available.

### ★★★★★ "Best Financial App"
*by Vivek T. - January 5, 2023*

CRED is hands down the best financial app I've used. The interface is beautiful, the features are useful, and the overall experience is seamless. I particularly like the spending insights and bill reminders. The rewards program isn't as generous as it used to be, but the convenience factor alone makes it worth using.

### ★★★ "Good App, Declining Rewards"
*by Sneha P. - November 20, 2022*

CRED has a beautiful interface and makes managing multiple credit cards simple. However, the rewards program has significantly deteriorated over the past year. The CRED coins are worth much less than before, and the cashbacks are minimal. It's still useful for bill payments and tracking, but don't expect much in terms of rewards anymore.

### ★★★★ "Useful Features"
*by Rohit K. - September 8, 2022*

CRED has some really useful features like bill reminders, spending analysis, and hidden charge detection. The interface is clean and modern. My only complaint is that they keep pushing their own financial products too aggressively. Otherwise, it's a solid app for credit card management.

### ★★ "Customer Service Issues"
*by Anjali D. - July 15, 2022*

The app itself works well, but their customer service is terrible. I had an issue with a payment that failed but the money was debited from my account. It took over 2 weeks and multiple emails to get a response, and even then the issue wasn't resolved properly. They need to improve their support system significantly.
